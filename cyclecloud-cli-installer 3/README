Azure CycleCloud command line tools
===================================
This package contains utilities that control and connect to Azure CycleCloud 
clusters and transfer data between different environments. After installation, 
the following commands will be available:

cyclecloud - Communicate with an Azure CycleCloud installation to create, 
             manage and connect to clusters.


Requirements
------------
Python 3.7+ must be installed and on your PATH as `python` or `python3`.


Installing on Windows
---------------------
Open a PowerShell prompt and run the following command:

    .\install.ps1

The install script updates the Windows system PATH so that the cyclecloud.exe
command is available in new Powershell sessions.


Installing on Linux and macOS
-----------------------------
On Linux/macOS the command line tools may be installed per user in each user's
~/bin directory or system-wide in /usr/local/bin.

If installing per-user, each user is responsible for putting ~/bin on their 
PATH. One way to do this is to add the following line to ~/.bash_profile:

    PATH=$PATH:~/bin

To install per-user (~/bin), run the following command:

    ./install.sh

To install system-wide (/usr/local/bin), run the following command:

    ./install.sh --system
